# A Collection of Cross-Sectional and Time-Series Generators


## Time-Series
[MTSS-GAN] - Multivariate conditional time series simulation using stacked generative adversarial learning for multi-attribute generation.
  > Developed by Derek Snow @firmai
[Time-GAN]( - Multivariate time series generation with an emphasis on autoregression errors to preserve temporal correlations.
  > Developed by Jinsung Yoon, Daniel Jarrett, Mihaela van der Schaar, forked code hosted by @firmai



## Cross-Sectional

### Privacy
[VAE-DP](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GR8Fx4zd7M-OKWI8gF20VwESS6Oml6Br) - Variational Autoencoder with Differential Privacy
  > Original model developed by [MIT](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDGym), differential privacy included by Derek Snow @firmai
